Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him. \"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood,\" said he. \"Thank you kindly, wolf.\" \"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\" \"To my grandmother's.\" \"What have you got in your apron?\" \"Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\" \"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\" \"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it,\" replied Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf thought to himself, \"What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\" So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, \"see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\" Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.</Text>\n",

But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child, take the pail, Little Red Riding Hood. I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough. Little Red Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Little Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.</Text>\n",

I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\" So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, \"see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.

So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \"Do I find you here, you old sinner,\" said he. \"I have long sought you.\" Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.</Text>\n",

It is also related that once when Little Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Little Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. \"Well,\" said the grandmother, \"we will shut the door, that he may not come in.\"</Text>\n",

    "Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy. One morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man. She added icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and eyes. When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy, \"You watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the garden.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So the old man and the old woman went out and began to dig potatoes, and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he started to day dream, and didn’t watch it all of the time. All of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped a gingerbread man, and went rolling along end over end towards the open door of the house. The little boy ran to shut the door, but the gingerbread man was too quick for him and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out into the road long before the little boy could catch him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The little boy ran after him as fast as he could manage, crying out to his grandfather and grandmother, who heard the noise, and threw down their spades in the garden to give chase too. The gingerbread man outran all three a long way, and was soon out of sight, while they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "On went the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to two men digging a well who looked up from their work and called out, \"Where ye going, gingerbread man?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He said, \"I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, and a little boy - and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You can, can you? We’ll see about that?\" Said they, and so they threw down their picks and ran after him, but couldn’t catch up with him, and soon they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "On ran the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to two men digging a ditch. \"Where ye going, gingerbread man?\" said they.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said, \"I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, and two well diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"\n",
    "\"You can, can you? We’ll see about that!\" said they, and they too threw down their spades, and ran after him. The gingerbread man soon outstripped them also, and seeing they could never catch him, gave up the chase and sat down to rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "On went the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said, \"Where are ye going, gingerbread man?\"\n",
    "He said, \"I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, and two ditch diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You can, can you?\" Growled the bear. \"We’ll see about that!\" He trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after the gingerbread man, who never stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind that he saw he might as well given up the hunt at the start, so he stretched himself out by the roadside to rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "On went the gingerbread man and by-and-by he came to a wolf. The wolf said, \"Where ye going, gingerbread man?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He said, \"I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers, and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You can, can you?\" Snarled the wolf. \"We’ll see about that!\" So he set into a gallop after the gingerbread man, who went on and on so fast, that the wolf too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down to rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "On went the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly in a corner of the fence. The fox called out in a sharp voice, but without getting up, \"Where ye going, gingerbread man?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He said: \"I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The fox said, \"I can’t quite hear you, gingerbread man. Won’t you come a little closer?\" Turning his head a little to one side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gingerbread man stopped his race for the first time, and went a little closer, and called out in a very loud voice, \"I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I still can’t quite hear you. Won’t you come a little closer?\" Said the fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards the gingerbread man, and put one paw behind his ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gingerbread man came up close, and leaning towards the fox, screamed out \"I’VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AN OLD WOMAN, A LITTLE BOY, TWO WELL DIGGERS, TWO DITCH DIGGERS, A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You can, can you?\" Yelped the fox, and he snapped up the gingerbread man in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.\n",

    "\"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it,\" replied Little Red Riding Hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wolf thought to himself, \"What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\" So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, \"see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Who is there?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf. \"She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Lift the latch,\" called out the grandmother, \"I am too weak, and cannot get up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "She called out, \"Good morning,\" but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, grandmother,\" she said, \"what big ears you have.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The better to hear you with, my child,\" was the reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The better to see you with, my dear.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But, grandmother, what large hands you have.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The better to hug you with.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The better to eat you with.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is snoring. I must just see if she wants anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \"Do I find you here, you old sinner,\" said he. \"I have long sought you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, \"Ah, how frightened I have been. How dark it was inside the wolf.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Little Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived, but Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also related that once when Little Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Little Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. \"Well,\" said the grandmother, \"we will shut the door, that he may not come in.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried, \"open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Little Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child, take the pail, Little Red Riding Hood. I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough. Little Red Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Little Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.\n",
